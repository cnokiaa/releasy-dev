    <string name="faq_q_1">How do I connect a device?</string>
    <string name="faq_a_1">→ Main interface \n→ Device \n→ Add a new device \n→ Search (M2 needs to select main unit and sub unit at the same time) \n→ Test (indicators twinkle as you feel slight massage feeling on the attached part of your skin) \n→ Bind device \n→ Back to main interface \n→ Choose your pavilion and begin massaging.</string>

    <string name="faq_q_2">How do I disconnect a device?</string>
    <string name="faq_a_2">Click「Device」at the main menu and then swipe to the left to reveal a column. Select「Delete」.</string>

    <string name="faq_q_3">How do I close the device using my mobile phone?</string>
    <string name="faq_a_3">Click「Device」at the main menu. Then, swipe left to reveal a column and select「PowerOff」. The indicator light will turn off when the device has shut down. </string>

    <string name="faq_q_4">How do I set the running time?</string>
    <string name="faq_a_4">→ Choose a certain pavilion. \n→ Slides tabs to change massage types. \n→ Tap + and - to adjust intensities. \n→ Touch the disc icon to choose music. \n→ Press play/pause to play/pause.</string>

    <string name="faq_q_5">Custom Pavilion</string>
    <string name="faq_a_5">Custom pavilion allows main device and sub device to excute different activities at the same time. For example, you can use 「elbow」 on your wrist and 「beat」 on your shoulder. It brings you a whole new experience. \nIn the custom pavilion, left side of the controller screen controls the main device, the right side of the controller screen controls the sub device. you can find the intensity adjust button on the bottom of the screen. after the configuration, you can use start/pause button to start/pause the whole process.\nCustom Pavilion only supports M2.</string>

    <string name="faq_q_6">Device Disconnected. What should I do?</string>
    <string name="faq_a_6">This is because the Bluetooth connection has been interrupted. Either the connection isn’t stable enough or the mobile phone is too far away from the device to connect (the correct distance is 10 metres). There isn’t much to be done when this occurs. Either wait until your connection is stable enough or reduce the distance between the device and the mobile phone. Click start button to run again. \nAnother possible cause is that the battery has dropped below 10%. If this happens, recharge your device. </string>

    <string name="faq_q_7">Why is the App running but I can\'t feel the massage?</string>
    <string name="faq_a_7">This is usually caused by low battery. If it is under 10%, recharge your device. </string>

    <string name="faq_q_8">How to activate the device in sleep?</string>
    <string name="faq_a_8">If the device standby time is over 30 minutes, It will automatically enter sleep in order to save power. The device can not be searched and controlled in sleep.\n\nAt this time, two pieces devices should be put together and separated after 1 second, then the devices will be activated and the indicator light will be lit. If the indicator light is in the extinguished state, it may be insufficient of power and should to be charged.</string>

    <string name="faq_q_9">What do I do if the device completely stops?</string>
    <string name="faq_a_9">The chances of this happening are very small. If it occurs, simply use a pin to press the reset button. The device will return to factory settings and will function perfectly.</string>

    <string name="faq_q_10">What is causing this prickling sensation during a massage?</string>
    <string name="faq_a_10">Because each person can have a different constitution, a different sensitivity and a different mental state at the time of use, sensations given off by the massage can seem different from one day to another. If you ever feel tingling, stop the device immediately and try again after some time has passed. If you would like to continue the massage, you will have to change the position of the chip until you no longer feel any tingling. It\'s possible that the viscosity of the chip is too low, which leads to prickling skin, meaning that the chip must be replaced. </string>

    <string name="faq_q_11">Which is the best place to put the device?</string>
    <string name="faq_a_11">The best areas are the back and shoulders, after that; the arms and legs. The device must never be placed on the head, neck or chest. </string>

    <string name="faq_q_12">Gel Pad Information</string>
    <string name="faq_a_12">The Gel Pad use silver needle weaving and hydrogel technology, which have nearly 0 resistances. The chip assures a smooth output and uniform distribution of pressure and is made of a thin, soft material. The chip can be attached in any position that you like as it’s comfortable, safe, it doesn’t sting and it can be washed. It’s anti-allergy, anti-sweat and doesn’t change colour, making it suitable for any skin type. The average amount of washes a Gel Pad can go through is 50. When the Gel Pad is washed, dry it before use. If there isn’t enough viscosity on the Gel Pad, it can give off a prickling sensation, this meaning that the Gel Pad must be replaced.</string>
